I really want to understand the source of the following bug and fix.

User commonly clicks between Level and GameplayMenu.
When this happens, the sound and back buttons are in the EXACT SAME PLACE in the two pages, at all screen sizes. This is good!

User commonly clicks between Level and TutorialMenu.
When this happens, the sound and back buttons are SLIGHLY HORIZONTALLY OFFSET in the two pages. This is bad! In this case the positioning in Level is correct (matches Level and Gameplay menu in the above case) and the positioning in TutorialMenu is incorrect.

Please study all three JSX files and their associated CSS files to understand why this visual bug happens, and fix it.
