In GameplayMenu, each world (once unlocked) has a button that takes you to the world's levels.
When a world is complete (its star level has been completed), I want the GameplayMenu to display a number of circles below the world's button.
The number of circles is equal to the number of words in that world, across all levels in the world, that match all of the world's rules.
A number of those circles should be filled, which corresponds to the number of correct words in that world that the user has selected across all levels, REGARDLESS of whether or not they have been completed.
The word must adhere to all of the world's rules AND the word must be selected for it to count towards a filled circle.
Whenever one of these words is selected/deselected, the code should update to change the number of filled circles for that world in GameplayMenu. It does not matter whether the level that has that word is complete.

Implement this for world one and world two.
