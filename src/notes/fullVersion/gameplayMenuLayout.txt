Update the menu layout based on the provided image.

Note that there will be GROUPS of SETS of LEVELS. The first group is called "tutorial", but the letters in the groupTitleBox are spaced out on three lines: "tut", "or", "ial". The groupTitleBox is purely for display purposes.

Please note that the space left and right of the groupTitleBox is space alloted for a conditional toNextGroup Triangle button on the right and a toPreviousGroup Triangle button on the left.

Please note that stars are conditional, awarded upon completion of the level set.

Please note that the letters in the groupTitleBox should be both horizontally and vertically centered.

Please note that level set boxes have a dark border.

When the final set of a group is completed, a right Triangle button will appear that when clicked, takes the user the next Group of Level Sets.

The first two Groups are: Tutorial, Letters.
