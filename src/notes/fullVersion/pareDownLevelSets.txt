**This has been implemented.**

To update the initial level sets, and the gameplay menu for the full version:

Remove all code and files exclusively utilized by the main sets of levels. These include: GameplayMenu.jsx, WorldOneLogo, WorldTwoLogo, WorldThreeLogo, worldOneRules.js, worldFourRules.js... and so on. Please intuit what all code and files to remove.

Remove the MainMenu tutorial button, and make the Play button go the TutorialMenu, which will be the new GameplayMenu (rename it to gameplay menu).
