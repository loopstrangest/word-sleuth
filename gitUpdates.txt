For future changes, you'll use this workflow:

Make your changes to the code
git add . (or git add specific-file for specific files)
git commit -m "Your commit message describing the changes"
git push

Some additional tips:

Use git status to see what files have changed
Use git log to see your commit history
Create meaningful commit messages that describe what changed
Consider creating different branches for new features
Remember to git pull before starting work if you're collaborating with others
